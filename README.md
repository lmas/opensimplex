[OpenSimplex] is a noise generation function like [Perlin] or [Simplex] noise, but better.

    OpenSimplex noise is an n-dimensional gradient noise function that was
    developed in order to overcome the patent-related issues surrounding
    Simplex noise, while continuing to also avoid the visually-significant
    directional artifacts characteristic of Perlin noise.

This is merely a python port of Kurt Spencer's [original code] (released to the public domain)
and neatly wrapped up in a package.

## Status

The `master` branch contains the latest code (possibly unstable),
with automatic tests running for **Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 on Linux, MacOS and Windows**.

Please refer to the [version tags] for the latest stable version.

Updates for **v0.4+**:

- Adds a hard dependency on 'Numpy', for array optimizations aimed at heavier workloads.
- Adds optional dependency on 'Numba', for further speed optimizations using caching
  (currently untested due to issues with llvmlite).
- Adds typing support.
- General refactor and cleanup of the library, tests and docs.
- **Breaking changes: API functions uses new names.**

## Usage

**Installation**

    pip install opensimplex

**Basic usage**

    >>> import opensimplex
    >>> opensimplex.seed(1234)
    >>> n = opensimplex.noise2(x=10, y=10)
    >>> print(n)
    0.580279369186297

**Running tests and benchmarks**

Setup a development environment:

    make dev
    source devenv/bin/activate
    make deps

And then run the tests:

    make test

Or the benchmarks:

    make benchmark

For more advanced examples, see the files in the [tests](./tests/) and [examples](./examples/) directories.

## API

**opensimplex.seed(seed)**

    Seeds the underlying permutation array (which produces different outputs),
    using a 64-bit integer number.
    If no value is provided, a static default will be used instead.

    seed(13)

**random_seed()**

    Works just like seed(), except it uses the system time (in ns) as a seed value.
    Not guaranteed to be random so use at your own risk.

    random_seed()

## FAQ

- What does the distribution of the noise values look like?

![Noise Distribution](https://github.com/lmas/opensimplex/raw/master/images/distribution.png)

- Is this relevantly different enough to avoid any real trouble with the
original patent?

    > If you read the [patent
    > claims](http://www.google.com/patents/US6867776):
    >
    > Claim #1 talks about the hardware-implementation-optimized
    > gradient generator. Most software implementations of Simplex Noise
    > don't use this anyway, and OpenSimplex Noise certainly doesn't.
    >
    > Claim #2(&3&4) talk about using (x',y',z')=(x+s,y+s,z+s) where
    > s=(x+y+z)/3 to transform the input (render space) coordinate onto
    > a simplical grid, with the intention to make all of the
    > "scissor-simplices" approximately regular. OpenSimplex Noise (in
    > 3D) uses s=-(x+y+z)/6 to transform the input point to a point on
    > the Simplectic honeycomb lattice so that the simplices bounding
    > the (hyper)cubes at (0,0,..,0) and (1,1,...,1) work out to be
    > regular. It then mathematically works out that s=(x+y+z)/3 is
    > needed for the inverse transform, but that's performing a
    > different (and opposite) function.
    >
    > Claim #5(&6) are specific to the scissor-simplex lattice. Simplex
    > Noise divides the (squashed) n-dimensional (hyper)cube into n!
    > simplices based on ordered edge traversals, whereas OpenSimplex
    > Noise divides the (stretched) n-dimensional (hyper)cube into n
    > polytopes (simplices, rectified simplices, birectified simplices,
    > etc.) based on the separation (hyper)planes at integer values of

    >
    > Another interesting point is that, if you read all of the claims,
    > none of them appear to apply to the 2D analogue of Simplex noise
    > so long as it uses a gradient generator separate from the one
    > described in claim #1. The skew function in Claim #2 only
    > applies to 3D, and #5 explicitly refers to n>=3.
    >
    > And none of the patent claims speak about using surflets /
