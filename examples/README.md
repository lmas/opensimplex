# Examples

- [distribution.m](./distribution.m): Matlab script to generate nice histogram for noise distributions.

- [histogram.py](./histogram.py): Python script to to generate same histogram, but in a CLI environment.

- [images.py](./images.py): Visualise noise on 2D images.

- [demo_looping_animated_2D_image.py](./demo_looping_animated_2D_image.py): Showcases the `looping_animated_2D_image()` function, which generates seamlessly-looping animated 2D images drawn from OpenSimplex noise.

- [demo_looping_animated_closed_1D_curve.py](./demo_looping_animated_closed_1D_curve.py): Showcases the `looping_animated_closed_1D_curve()` function, which generates seamlessly-looping animated 1D curves, each curve in turn also closing up seamlessly back-to-front, all drawn from OpenSimplex noise.

- [demo_tileable_2D_image.py](./demo_tileable_2D_image.py): Showcases the `demo_tileable_2D_image()` function, which generates a seamlessly-tileable 2D image drawn from OpenSimplex noise.
